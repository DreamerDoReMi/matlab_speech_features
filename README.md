matlab_speech_features
======================

A set of speech feature extraction functions for ASR and speaker identification written in matlab.

currently implemented:

Feature | Description
--------| -----------
 MFCCs | Mel frequency cepstral coefficients
 LFBE | Log filterbank energies
 SSC | Spectral Subband Centroids
 LPCs | Linear prediction coefficients
 LPCCs | Linear prediction cepstral coefficients
 LSF | line spectral frequencies
 LAR | log area ratios
 RC | reflection coefficients

To be implemented:

- PLP

Currently this code isn't well commented, though hopefully this will change in time. There is also no documentation 
at the moment, this well be hopefully auto-generated once commenting has been completed.
